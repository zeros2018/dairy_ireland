I was in latin America a while ago and could not find any normal milk at all,  even in their big shopping centres. Probably the non stop heat makes it difficult \/ costly to transport fresh milk"}

All served as traditional doctors for decades but are now saying the same thing about food. They have nothing to profit from the lifestyle they try to promote. But big farmers and supermarkets have lots of profits to be made from selling milk, while big pharma have lots of profits to be made from selling medication to treat us afterwards."}
